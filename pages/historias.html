                <h3 class="tituloprincipalbmx">A Short History Of Freestyle BMX</h3>
            
                <p class="primerparrafobmx">The freestyle BMX scene really kicked off in the mid-1970s, when people took their rides along to concrete<br> skate parks and reservoir channels in San Diego in California and started to shred.<br>Basically, they realised that they were having a damn good time and looking pretty damn cool<br></p>
            
                <p class="segundoparrafobmx">
                It was bound to take off.
                Way back in 1976, Bob Haro and John Swanguen were riding in<br> skateparks and already inventing new tricks on the streets. Haro soon got involved at BMX Action Magazine where he met R.L Osborn,<br> which lead to the formation of the first freestyle BMX team, the BMX Action Trick Team, in 1979.<br></p>
            
                <p class="tercerparrafobmx">
                The team was created when Osborn and Haro were asked to do a BMX demonstration at a motocross race,<br> and while that particular show would never go through, it laid the future for the trick team and many others like it.<br></p>
            
                <p class="cuartoparrafobmx">
                Members of the Action Trick Team came and went in its seven year history, though R.L Osborn was ever-present.<br> After Haro had left in the early 80s, the team included the ever-popular Mike Buff for a time,<br> Pat Romano, who brought fixed gear and fork pegs to BMX, and finally Ron Wilton.</p>
